# Description
A Frontend Developer Take-Home Test from playa3ull

Develop a responsive e-commerce web application

# Functions
- Google authentication & Guest login
- Product Listing Page
- Product detail Page
- Shopping Cart
- Responsive Design
- Simple Checkout (To not confuse user, this checkout is a fake checkout, do not have any banking connection)

# All technologies I have used in this project
## Frameworks & Libraries
- **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, **react-icons/fi**

## State Management
- **Zustand**: After researching, Zustand is the recommended choice for e-commerce or shopping websites.

## TypeScript
- Applied for type-checking wherever possible.

## API
- **RESTful API** endpoints from FakeAPI.
- I tried to find a **GraphQL API**, which I’m also familiar with, but they were all empty. I’m not sure why.
- I can share the **GraphQL API** I’m working with if needed. It belongs to Thinkific, so sharing it does not violate any laws.

## Code Quality
- **S.O.L.I.D** principles
- **Compound Components** pattern

## Testing
- Not implemented in this project.
